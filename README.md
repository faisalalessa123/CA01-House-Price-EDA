# CA01 — House Price Exploratory Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a residential housing dataset conducted as part of CA01. The purpose of this analysis is to investigate the structure and quality of the data, identify key variables that influence house prices, and prepare the dataset for future predictive modeling.

The notebook walks through a structured analytical workflow including data inspection, summary statistics, visualization, missing value treatment, and outlier handling. Relationships between numerical variables are also explored through correlation analysis to better understand which features may be strong predictors of sale price.

## Analytical Approach
The analysis follows a logical progression:

- Loading and inspecting the dataset  
- Understanding variable distributions  
- Detecting and treating missing values  
- Identifying and removing extreme outliers  
- Exploring relationships between features and sale price  
- Generating insights to support future machine learning models  

This process ensures the dataset is clean, interpretable, and suitable for downstream modeling tasks.

## Tools and Technologies
The project was completed using:

- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualization  
- **Google Colab** for development  

## Repository Contents
- **CA01_House_Price_EDA.ipynb** — Main notebook containing the full analysis  
- **README.md** — Project documentation  

## Key Outcome
The exploratory analysis highlights several variables that show strong relationships with house prices, such as overall material quality, above-ground living area, total basement square footage, and garage capacity. These findings establish a solid foundation for building accurate house price prediction models in future work.
